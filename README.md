In July 2021, I completed a course on codecademy called "Learn Data Analysis with Pandas". It taught the basics of Pandas package in Python.

The course contained three small "projects" - real-life-like tasks designed for practicing Pandas commands.
I am publishing my solutions to those here.

Project "Petal Power Inventory" taught general data loading and dataframe modification.
Project "AB Testing for Shoefly.com" taught aggregate functions.
Project "Page Visits Funnel" taught using and querying multiple dataframes.
